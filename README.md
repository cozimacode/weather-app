It was a good challenge to assess the ability of a React dev. I'd have done more if I had more time. I have configured webpack from scratch instead of using CRA and finished all the requirements listed in the challenge except geolocation API.

**npm install** will install all the deps. **firebase serve** will start the app in development mode locally and **npm run build** will spit out the production code.
